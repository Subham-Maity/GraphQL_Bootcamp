## What is GraphQL and why should you use it? üöÄ

GraphQL is a technology that allows you to query and manipulate data from a server using a single endpoint. It is different from REST API, which is the traditional way of building web services. In this article, I will explain what GraphQL is, the problems it solves, and how it compares to REST API.

## The problems with REST API üòï

REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and conventions for designing web services that allow clients to access and modify data on a server. A typical REST API consists of multiple endpoints, each representing a different resource or entity. For example, you might have endpoints like `/users`, `/posts`, `/comments`, etc.

However, REST API has some limitations and challenges that make it difficult to work with complex data. Here are some of them:

### Over-fetching üì¶

Over-fetching means that the client receives more data than it needs from the server. For example, suppose you want to display a list of users with their names and email addresses on your website. You might use the endpoint `/users` to get all the user data from the server. However, this endpoint might also return other information that you don't need, such as passwords, phone numbers, addresses, etc. This wastes bandwidth and slows down your application.

To solve this problem, you might create another endpoint that returns only the fields that you need, such as `/users/summary`. However, this is not a good idea because it increases the complexity and maintenance of your API. You have to create multiple endpoints for different scenarios and keep them updated.

### Under-fetching üöö

Under-fetching means that the client receives fewer data than it needs from the server. For example, suppose you want to display a user profile with their name, email address, and the posts they have created on your website. You might use the endpoint `/users/:userId` to get the user data from the server. However, this endpoint might not return the posts data that you need. You might have to use another endpoint `/posts?userId=:userId` to get the posts data from the server. This requires multiple API calls and increases the complexity of your application.

To solve this problem, you might create another endpoint that returns both the user and posts data in one response, such as `/users/:userId/profile`. However, this is not a good idea because it couples your data and makes your API less flexible. You have to create multiple endpoints for different combinations of data and keep them updated.

### The solution with GraphQL ‚ú®

GraphQL is a technology that solves these problems by allowing you to query and manipulate data from a server using a single endpoint. GraphQL stands for Graph Query Language. It is a syntax for describing the data that you want from the server. You can specify exactly what fields and properties you need, and the server will return only those data in a JSON format.

For example, suppose you want to display a user profile with their name, email address, and the posts they have created on your website. You can use GraphQL to write a query like this:

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
```

This query will tell the server to return only the name, email, and posts fields of the user with id "123". The server will respond with a JSON object like this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com",
      "posts": [
        {
          "title": "Hello world",
          "content": "This is my first post"
        },
        {
          "title": "GraphQL rocks",
          "content": "This is my second post"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see, GraphQL can solve both over-fetching and under-fetching problems by allowing you to get only the data that you need with one API call.



### How GraphQL works üõ†

GraphQL works by using three main components: queries, mutations, and resolvers.

#### Queries üìù

Queries are used to fetch data from the server. They are written in GraphQL syntax and sent as POST requests to the GraphQL endpoint (usually something like `/graphql`). Queries can have arguments (such as `id: "123"`) to specify which data you want to get. Queries can also have nested fields (such as `posts { title content }`) to specify which properties you want to get for each data.

#### Mutations üöß

Mutations are used to modify data on the server. They are also written in GraphQL syntax and sent as POST requests to the GraphQL endpoint. Mutations can have arguments (such as `input: { title: "New post", content: "This is a new post" }`) to specify which data you want to create, update, or delete. Mutations can also have fields (such as `post { id title content }`) to specify which data you want to get back after the mutation.

#### Resolvers üîé

Resolvers are functions that handle the queries and mutations on the server. They are written in the programming language of your choice (such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, etc.) and connected to your GraphQL schema (which defines the types and fields of your data). Resolvers take the arguments and fields from the queries and mutations and perform the logic to get or modify the data from your data sources (such as databases, APIs, files, etc.). Resolvers then return the data in the format that matches the queries and mutations.

### How to test GraphQL queries üß™

One of the benefits of GraphQL is that it comes with a tool called GraphQL Playground that allows you to test your queries and mutations and see the results in real time. You don't need to install anything extra or use another tool like Postman. You just need to open your browser and go to your GraphQL endpoint (usually something like `/graphql`).




Like Postman, GraphQL Playground allows you to send queries and mutations as POST requests to your GraphQL endpoint.
